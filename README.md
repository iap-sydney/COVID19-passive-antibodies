# Project template

This repository provides a project template for analytics projects. 

Key features include:

- `driver.R` which can run the analysis from start to finish
- `setup.R` which loads all libraries and default variables used throughout
- `.gitignore` which list files and directories which should be ignored by `git`
- `raw-data/` which holds raw-data files. 
- `processing/` which hold a script to clean and process data before analysis
- `analysis/` which hold scripts used to analyse data and generate outputs
- `output/` which holds outputs (tables, figures and data generated by the analysis)
